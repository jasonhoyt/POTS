Welcome to POTS (Purchase Order Tracking System)

The plan is:
Enter products I want to be able to buy. Keep track of pricing I get from different vendors. As new projects come up (In my case I need to buy components to go into a RTU/PLC enclosures) be able to select items that I need (with quantity) to be added to a project. After I have fully designed the panel I want to be able to convert the items in the project to purchase orders to the different vendors that I am buying them from. As the products get delivered I want to check them in and have them put into an inventory. I want to be able to track the lifecycle of some items within the inventory; they will be assigned/labeled with an Asset ID so a history can be tracked. As I use items I want to pull them from inventory. I have to keep track of accounts that each item gets used on. As I order parts I buy spares parts as well and want to keep track of the spare parts by account. Spare parts will be used by any account that needs them even if they have yet to buy that spare part, but they will buy the new part that will go towards the account they ‘borrowed’ it from. I also have to reconcile my credit card statement so I need to keep track of all receipts.

This is probably an ambitious project for my first rails project, but I can’t stand creating dumb little projects just to get one concept. Jump in and let need be my mother of invention.
